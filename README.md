> Collection of application-layer protocols built on top of [`smoltcp`].

This crate aims to follow the same guinding principles of `smoltcp`: simplicity and robustness.
It is a `#![no_std]`-first crate, designed for bare-metal, real-time systems.
Heap allocations (if at all present) will be reduced to a minimum, and will always be feature gated.

The following protocols are implemented at this time:

* Simple Network Time Protocol (**SNTPv4**, client only)
* Trivial File Transfer Protocol (**TFTP**, server only)

[`smoltcp`]: https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp

## Requirements

* Rust 1.43+

## Examples

See the [examples] directory for examples and instructions on how to use this crate
in a hosted Linux environment. For bare-metal examples, refer to the documentation
and the [loopback example] of smoltcp.

## Features

The following features can be enabled at the crate level and are _disabled_ by default:

* `sntp` to enable compilation of the SNTP client
* `tftp` to enable compilation of the TFTP server
